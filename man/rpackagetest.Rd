\section{Documentation options}{
 Here too we can of course use all the
  available object documentation \code{@tags} - if applicable.
}

\section{Conventions}{
 Here are some recommendations for documenting packages:
  \itemize{ \item If provided, put the package documentation in file name
  \emph{<package-name>.R}. \item It has to be labelled with \code{@docType
  package}. \item It must have a \code{@name} specifying the package name.
  \item Since it must not contain functions, it has to document \strong{NULL}
  }
}
