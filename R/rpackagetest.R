#' rpackagetest: A package to test the creation and maintenance of R packages
#'
#' As stated this is just a sandbox for experimenting with the different
#' elements of R packages.
#'
#' @section Documentation options: Here too we can of course use all the
#'   available object documentation \code{@@tags} - if applicable.
#'
#' @section Conventions: Here are some recommendations for documenting packages:
#'   \itemize{ \item If provided, put the package documentation in file name
#'   \emph{<package-name>.R}. \item It has to be labelled with \code{@@docType
#'   package}. \item It must have a \code{@@name} specifying the package name.
#'   \item Since it must not contain functions, it has to document \strong{NULL}
#'   }
#'
#' @docType package
#' @name rpackagetest
NULL
