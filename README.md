# README
This repository is a sample R package which has been set up to explore the different steps in creating and maintaining an R package. 

It follows the R package book (http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz) closely. I have created branches that essentially correspond to the chapters in the book. I have been using rather atomic commits to highlight the most important steps or configuration options. 

# Notes on package structure

## _DESCRIPTION_ ([Book chapter](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/description.html))
For a sample R package _DESCRIPTION_ file check here for example: https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/blob/master/DESCRIPTION


**Author(s) and Maintainer(s)**

The generated R package DESCRIPTION file lists both an `Author` and `Maintainer`. It is however recommended to use the `Authors@R` field. For example:

```
Authors@R: person("Mac", "D", email = "yourself@somewhere.net", 
  role = c("aut", "cre")
```

**LICENSE**
I left this open. If it is specified a _LICENSE_ file needs to be added. It is easiest to use GitHub for this and select an appropriate license. If chosen, GitHub will add the license file to the repo.
