# README
This repository is a sample R package which has been set up to explore the different steps in creating and maintaining an R package. 

It follows the R package book (http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz) closely. I have created branches that essentially correspond to the chapters in the book. I have been using rather atomic commits to highlight the most important steps or configuration options.
